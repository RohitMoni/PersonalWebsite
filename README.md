# Personal Website

This is my personal website, built using Hugo and hosted via Github Pages.
This is currently WIP.
See the [live](https://RohitMoni.github.io/PersonalWebsite) version.

## Requirements

Hugo

## Getting Started

Run the server locally with `hugo server -D`

## Todo:
- Get new pictures for the main page
- Use my custom domain (rohitmoni.com)

## Acknolwedgements

As much as I like the idea of design, I didn't design the page. I'm using an awesome theme from Raditian that can be found [here](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme).
